# 01.01 Foundations of Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence

## 1.1 Defining Physical AI
Physical AI represents the next stage of artificial intelligence, moving beyond digital environments (like chatbots or gaming AI) into the **physical world**. The core goal of Physical AI is to build systems that can directly perceive, interact with, and manipulate real-world objects while understanding **physical laws** (like gravity, friction, and inertia).

## 1.2 Embodied Intelligence (EI)
The term **Embodied Intelligence** refers to the idea that an agent's intelligence is deeply tied to its **physical body (embodiment)** and its interactions with the environment.
* **Traditional AI:** Works with abstract data (text, images). Intelligence is disembodied.
* **Embodied AI:** Works with sensory data (LiDAR, force feedback). Intelligence develops from movement and interaction.

> **Why Embodiment Matters:** A humanoid robot cannot learn to maintain balance just by reading physics equations; it must physically experience **falling** and **correcting itself** in the real world or a high-fidelity simulation.

## 1.3 Key Principles of Physical AI

| Principle | Description | Example in Humanoids |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Situated Cognition** | The AI's decisions are based on its current location and immediate physical state. | A robot uses live camera data to avoid tripping over a wire right now. |
| **Sensorimotor Loop** | The continuous cycle of Perception (sensing the environment), Action (moving the body), and Feedback (receiving results). | Reading force sensors $\rightarrow$ Adjusting foot placement $\rightarrow$ Reading new force sensors. |
| **Real-Time Operation** | Actions must be computed and executed within milliseconds to maintain physical stability (e.g., balance control). | A lag of 50ms can cause a bipedal robot to fall over. |
